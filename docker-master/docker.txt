docker 
docker version 
docker --version 
docker info 

Docker containers 

docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach --name webhost nginx 
docker container run --publish 8080:8080 --detach --name webhost2 nginx

docker container ls - retrieve id of containers 

docker container stop $1 $2 etc

docker container prune to remove all containers 

docker rmi nginx 


What happens?
1. Looks for that image locally in image cache, doesn't find anything. 
2. Then looks in remote image repository (defaults to Docker hub). 
3. Downloads the latest version (nginx:latest by default).
4. Creates new container based on that image and prepares to start. 
5. Gives it a virtual IP on a private network inside docker engine.
6. Opens up port 80 on host and forwards to port 80 in container. 
7. Starts container by using the CMD in the image Dockerfile. 


- Docker containers are NOT vms. 
- Docker is a process.
