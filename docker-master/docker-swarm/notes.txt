Docker Swarm - Notes 

Containers Everywhere = New Problems 
1. How do we automate container lifecycle? 
2. How can we easily scale out/in/up/down?
3. How can we ensure our containers are re-created if they fail?
4. How can we replace containers without downtime (blue/green deploy)? 
5. How can we control/track where containers get started? 
6. How can we create cross-node virtual networks? 
7. How can we ensure only trusted servers run our containers? 
8. How can we store secrets, keys, passwords and get them to the right container (and only that container)?

Swarm Mode: Built-in Orchestration 
- Swarm mode is a clustering solution build inside Docker.
- Not related to Swarm "classic" for pre-1.12 versions. 
- Added in 1.12 (Summer 2016) via Swarmkit toolkit.
- Enhanced in 1.13 (January 2017) via Stacks and Secrets.
- Not enabled by default, new commands once enabled:
   - docker swarm
   - docker node
   - docker service
   - docker stack
   - docker secret

# docker swarm init 
Workers::Raft Database 

# Raft consensus group::Internal Distributed state store::Manager::Worker::GossipNetwork
# service -> replicas -> task -> container -> available node
