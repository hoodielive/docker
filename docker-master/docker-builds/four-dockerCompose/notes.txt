docker-compose CLI

- its a separate binary 
- Not designed to be a production-grade tool but ideal for local dev and test 
- Two most common commands are:

# CLI most common 
docker-compose up  # setup volumes/networks and start all containers
docker-compose down  # stop all containers and remove cont/vol/net 

If all your projects had a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml then "new developer onboarding" would be: 
- git clone githumb.come/<env>
- docker compose-up

# Other Commands 
- docker-compose top 
- docker-compose ps 
- docker-compose 

Using Compose to Build 
- Compose can also build your custom images 
- Will build them with docker-compose up if not found in cache
- Also rebuild with docker-compose build
- Great for complex builds that have lots of vars or build args
