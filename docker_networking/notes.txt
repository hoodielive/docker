3 Pillars 

CNM - GRAND/design DNA of Docker Networking 

CNM -> Libnetwork -> Drivers 

Whitepaper (required reading if you expect to know what's going on)
https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/blob/master/docs/design.md

Container Network Model 
Docker origin in Docker, Inc.

'vs'

CNI (Container Network Interface) -> custom built for Kubernetes -> Kubernetes origin is CoreOS, Inc.

CNM 
Sandbox A.K.A namespace -> ENDPOINT -> Network 
Contains full Network Stack (Sandbox)
Network Interface (eth0, Endpoint) 
Connected Endpoints (Network) 

Libnetwork (goLang) 
Central place for all Docker Networking (canonical implementation)
X-platform Pluggable
Written in Go/GoLang
Real-world implementation of CNM by Docker, Inc. 
SocketPlane
https://github.com/docker/libnetwork
Control plane and management plane

Drivers
Network-specific detail 
- Overlay
- MacVLAN
- IPVLAN
- Bridge 
- Host
- None

Data Plane Management
Local = native 
Remote = 3rd party
Remote drivers - Calico, Contiv, Kuryr, Weave
Docker (Engine)

CNM
Master plan/grand design 

Libnetwork 
Defacto Implementation of the CNM

Drivers 
Network-specific details
