Network Namespaces (7) - Chopped and Screwed

Overview of Linux Namespaces

- Provide(s) namespaces isolation of the system resources associated with networking:
	- Network Device(s)
	- IPv4 and Ipv6 protocol stacks
	- IP routing tables
	- Firewall Rules
	- /proc/net directory (which is a symbolic link /proc/PID/net)
	- The /sys/class/net directory
	- Various Files under /proc/sys/net
	- Port Numbers (sockets)
	- Etc.

	Network namespaces isolate the UNIX domain abstract socket namespace.

- A physical network device can live in exactly one network namespace.

- When a network namespace is freed (i.e., when the last process in the namespace terminates), its
  physical network device(s) are moved back to the initial network namespace (not to the parent of the process).

- A virtual network (veth(4)) device pair provides a pipe-like abstraction that can be used
  to create a bridge to a physical network device in another namespace.

- When a namespace is freed, the veth(4) device(s) that it contains are destroyed.

- Use of network namespaces require a kernel that is configured with the CONFIG_NET_NS option.
